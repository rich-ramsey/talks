## Talk overview

1.  Context.
2.  Caution.
3.  Regression.
4.  Summary.

**Aim:** Provide a context for thinking about data analysis and statistics.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a statistician. I'm not a statistician. I'm not a statistician. I'm not a ...

# Context

## Sampling from a larger population

```{r sampling-plot, fig.cap="Image from: https://danawanzer.github.io/stats-with-jamovi/"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/descriptive_vs_inference.png")
```

## My background

<br>

-   Cognitive neuroscience / experimental psychology.

<br>

-   Social perception and cognition.

<br>

-   I am not a statistician. (Did I say that already?)

## My background

<br>

**My undergrad and postgrad stats classes looked like this:**

-   Each week described a different statistical test.

-   Your job was to choose the right test for a given type of data and run the test (usually via point-and-click in SPSS).

-   Then you interpret the p-value.

-   Easy, right?

## My background

**In the wake of the reproducibility crisis:**

-   I felt the need to become more statistically literate.

-   Enter:

    -   Richard McElreath's excellent textbook [@mcelreath2020] 
    -   Solomon Kurz's brilliant translation into `tidyverse` principles [@kurzStatisticalRethinkingSecondEd2023].
    -   Various papers and books by [Andrew Gelman](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/){target='_blank'}.

# Caution #

## Champagne inference on a beer budget

<br>

A quote from Andrew Gelman [(Gelman, 2024)](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/jcp.pdf){target='_blank'}:

> once the data have been collected, the most important decisions have already been done

## Champagne inference on a beer budget

All statistical models are fundamentally limited and need to be framed within the wider scientific context, such as ... [@mcelreath2020]:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The importance of theory
-   Open data and materials
-   Pre-registration
-   Meta-analyses
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Computational modelling
-   Data science
-   Experimental design
-   And many more besides

## Champagne inference on a beer budget

Before we make inferences and draw conclusions, we should spend more time [@scheel2021]:

-   Forming concepts.
-   Developing valid measures.
-   Identifying boundary conditions and auxillary assumptions.
-   And so on...

## Caution (!) is required

<br>

-   Statistical inference is not magical.
-   Inferences rest on a bunch of assumptions and data quality.
-   Inferences are likely to be fragile/tentative/suggestive.
-   So, be cautious!
-   And try to create research designs that do not rely too heavily on one particular part of your inferential model.

## Towards statistical *thinking*

<br>

-   Develop a statistical philosophy rather than rely on historical statistical rituals [@gigerenzer2018].
-   There are many different approaches to the same question.
-   Have a sense of how your approach fits into the mix of options, in terms of pros and cons.
-   Be able to defend and justify your choices explicitly.

# A very brief introduction to multi-level regression

## Multi-level regression: why bother?

<br>

-   One general and versatile way to approach data analysis.
-   It avoids the obsession with picking the "right" statistical test.
-   There is an active community of users and lots of resources available to guide you.

## Statistical tests are forms of linear regression

```{r tests-as-linear-plot, fig.cap= "https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tests_as_linear_models_top.png")
```

## Summary vs trial-level data

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![summary / aggregated data](images/agg_data.png){fig.align="center" height="500px"}

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Partial pooling or shrinkage

### let's build in an intuition

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r fam-height-plot}
knitr::include_graphics("images/family_height.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r pop-plot}
knitr::include_graphics("images/population.png")
```
:::
:::::

## Partial pooling or shrinkage

### let's plot it

```{r pooling-plot}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pooling_plot.png")
```

## Fixed and varying effects

<br>

```{r model-formula-fixed, echo=TRUE}
## specify the model formula with only fixed or population-level terms
formula = dv ~ 1 + condition 
```

<br>

```{r model-formula-vary-intercepts, echo=TRUE}
## and now add varying intercepts per participant
formula = dv ~ 1 + condition +
          (1 | participant)
```

<br>

```{r model-formula-vary-slopes, echo=TRUE}
## and now add varying intercepts and slopes per participant
formula = dv ~ 1 + condition +
          (1 + condition | participant)
```

## Estimation approaches - basics

```{r estimation-approaches, fig.cap="adapted from [(Kruschke & Liddell, 2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1221-4){target='_blank'}"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/kruschke_plot.png")
```

## Estimation approaches - parameters

```{r coef-plot}
knitr::include_graphics("images/coef_plot.png")
```

## Estimation approaches - wider reading

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="33.3%"}
```{r winter-book, out.height="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/winter_book.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="33.3%"}
```{r mcelreath-book, out.height="25%"}

# Summary

## Science needs more David Bowie

<br>

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Statistical reform is important.

-   But science is not a one-trick pony.

-   We need more David Bowie.
